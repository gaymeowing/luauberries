# Installing

Info on how to install Luauberries, and Luauberries libraries

> [!NOTE]
> Luauberries is not avaliable on any package managers, as I'm waiting for luau to get an offical package manager before bothering with any of that.

## Methods

### Releases

For every library there's a release containing a zip file for that library, and a rbxm. There's also a rbxm and zip file that includes dependencies for that library, if that library has dependencies, just look for `-deps` at the end of file names.
