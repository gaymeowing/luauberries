## Types

> [!NOTE]
> `character.Character` is a reference to the [`Character`](https://libs.luau.lol/character#character-1) type in the character library


### `ZoneType`

```luau
type ZoneType = "WHITELIST" | "BLACKLIST"
```

### `PlayerZoneInfo`

> [!WARNING]
> This type isn't exported, its just documented because of [`BaseZone`](#basezone) referencing it.

```luau
type PlayerZoneInfo = {
	character: character.Character,
	rootpart: BasePart,
	position: Vector3,
	player: Player,
}
```
* `character` - a reference to the current character of the player
* `rootpart` - a reference to the PrimaryPart of the character
* `position` - the current position of the player's character
* `player` - a reference to the [`Player`]() this [`PlayerZoneInfo`](#playerzoneinfo) is for

### `BaseZone`

```luau
type BaseZone<Type = ZoneType> = {
	callback: (character: character.Character, player: Player) -> (),
	blacklist: { PlayerZoneInfo },
	size_halved_x: number,
	size_halved_y: number,
	size_halved_z: number,
	cframe: CFrame,
	size: Vector3,
	id: number,
	type: Type,
}
```
* `callback` - the callback to be called when a player thats not allowed in the zone is found in the zone
* `blacklist` - an array of [`PlayerZoneInfos`](#playerzoneinfo) for every player thats not allowed in the zone
* `id` - a unique identifying number for the zone, intended to be used for replication
* `size_halved_x` - the x axis of the zones size halved
* `size_halved_x` - the y axis of the zones size halved
* `size_halved_z` - the z axis of the zones size halved
* `type` - the [`ZoneType`](#zonetype) for the zone
* `cframe` - the [`CFrame`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/CFrame) of the zone
* `size` - the size of the zone

### `WhitelistZone`

```luau
type WhitelistZone = BaseZone<"WHITELIST"> & {
	whitelisted: { Player },
}
```
* `whitelisted` - an array of players that are allowed to be in the zone

### `BlacklistZone`

```luau
type BlacklistZone = BaseZone<"BLACKLIST"> & {
	blacklisted: { Player },
}
```
* `blacklisted` - an array of players that are not allowed to be in the zone

### `Zone`

```luau
type Zone = BlacklistZone | WhitelistZone
```

### `ZoneInfo`

```luau
type ZoneInfo<Type = ZoneType> = {
	callback: (character: character.Character, player: Player) -> (),
	cframe: CFrame,
	size: Vector3,
	type: Type?,
}
```
* `callback` - the callback to be ran when a player thats not allowed to be in the given zone is in the zone
* `cframe` - the [`CFrame`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/CFrame) for the zone
* `size` - the size of the zone
* `type` - the type of zone this is (default: "BLACKLIST")

## Methods

### `create`

Creates a new player zone from the provided [`ZoneInfo`](#zoneinfo)

```luau
local zone = playerzone.create({
	cframe = CFrame.new(12.4, 50, 2),
	size = Vector3.new(10, 20, 10),
	type = "WHITELIST"
})
```

### `destroy`

Destroys a player zone allowing it to be gc'd

```luau
local zone = playerzone.create({
	cframe = CFrame.new(12.4, 50, 2),
	size = Vector3.new(10, 20, 10),
})

playerzone.destroy(zone)
```

### `insert`

Inserts a player to the whitelist or blacklist depending on the [`ZoneType`](#zonetype) of the player zone

```luau
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local zone = playerzone.create({
	cframe = CFrame.new(12.4, 50, 2),
	size = Vector3.new(10, 20, 10),
})

CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovingSignal("ALLLOWED"):Connect(function(player: Player)
	playerzone.insert(zone, player)
end :: any)
```

### `remove`

Removes a player from the whitelist or blacklist depending on the [`ZoneType`](#zonetype) of the player zone

```luau
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local zone = playerzone.create({
	cframe = CFrame.new(12.4, 50, 2),
	size = Vector3.new(10, 20, 10),
})

CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovingSignal("ALLLOWED"):Connect(function(player: Player)
	playerzone.remove(zone, player)
end :: any)

```
